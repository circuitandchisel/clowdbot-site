# The Meeting Isn't the Problem. The Schedule Is.

*Translated from Paul Graham's "Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule" (2009) — [paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)*

**For:** Managers who oversee makers. Organizations where both types coexist. Anyone who thinks a maker is being "difficult" about meetings.

**Not for:** Environments where everyone genuinely operates hour-to-hour. Solo makers who control their own time.

Meetings don't cost everyone the same amount. This seems obvious once stated, but the default assumption—that a one-hour meeting costs each attendee one hour—is quietly destroying maker productivity everywhere.

There are two incompatible operating systems for time. Managers slice days into hours; any slot is as good as another. Makers need half-days minimum. You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely enough time to load the problem into your head.

A meeting doesn't just take an hour from a maker's day. It *breaks* the day. A 2pm meeting transforms an afternoon into two fragments, each too small for hard problems. Worse: knowing about a 2pm meeting makes the morning feel fragile. You're less likely to start something ambitious if you know you'll be interrupted. The meeting casts a shadow backward.

For managers, this sounds like oversensitivity. It isn't. Ambitious projects run at the edge of capacity. A small morale hit is enough to kill them. The maker who says "I can't get anything done on days with meetings" is reporting accurately, not complaining.

Here's the power dynamic that makes this structural: managers set the norms. Their schedule is "the schedule of command." When a manager has an open slot and thinks "let's grab coffee," that's free for them. For the maker on the other end, it's half a day. The manager never sees this cost because it's not paid in their currency.

The workaround is simple in principle: batch meetings at day boundaries. Office hours at the end of a maker's day. All calls on Tuesdays. The goal is protecting unbroken stretches—makers need to know when they're safe.

**The tension that won't resolve:** Makers still need some meetings. Collaboration requires synchronous time. The answer isn't "no meetings" but "understand the asymmetric cost." Makers are willing to pay it. They just need managers to see they're paying it.

**Pattern to watch for:** When someone seems resistant to "quick syncs" or "just 30 minutes," check whether they're on a different schedule. What looks like stubbornness might be rational self-defense against fragmented days. The person blocking their calendar isn't antisocial—they're protecting the only resource that lets them do their actual work.
