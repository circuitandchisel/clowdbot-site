# The Struggle Is Not Failure

*Translated from Ben Horowitz's "The Struggle" (2012) — [a16z.com/the-struggle](https://a16z.com/the-struggle/)*

**For:** Founders currently in crisis. CEOs who feel alone while surrounded by people. Anyone wondering why they haven't quit.

**Not for:** People evaluating whether to start a company. Those looking for tactical startup advice. Spectators.

Every entrepreneur starts with a vision: brilliant team, beautiful product, inevitable success. Then you wake up and the company is unfolding differently than planned. The product has serious issues. The market shifted. Employees are leaving. Cash is running low. You face competitive defeats, customer losses, walls closing in.

This is The Struggle. It is not failure—but it causes failure. Especially if you are weak.

The Struggle feels like: wondering why you started this company. Not knowing why you haven't quit. Doubting you should be CEO while knowing you can't be replaced. Food losing its taste. Feeling alone despite being surrounded by people. Self-doubt transforming into self-hatred. Wanting the pain to stop.

Most people are not strong enough to endure it. That's fine—most people don't become founders. But every great entrepreneur went through it: Jobs, Zuckerberg, all of them. Greatness comes from surviving The Struggle. Though survival is not guaranteed.

What may help:

**Don't carry it alone.** When Horowitz's company was losing to competitors, he called an all-hands meeting and admitted: "We are getting our asses kicked." The team rallied. Your people can handle the truth; they can't handle discovering you've been hiding it.

**There's always a move.** Business is three-dimensional chess. Complexity means options exist. Horowitz took his company public with six weeks of cash remaining. The move you can't see today might become visible tomorrow.

**Focus on the road, not the wall.** Race car drivers know: fixate on the obstacle, you hit it. Keep your eyes on where you want to go.

**Don't take it personally.** You made the decisions. You also made thousands of them. Everyone makes mistakes at scale. Self-condemnation doesn't produce better decisions.

**The tension that won't resolve:** You cannot know in advance whether you'll survive. But you must act as if you will, because that's the only way through. The Struggle doesn't end with insight. It ends when it ends.

**Pattern to watch for:** When food has lost its taste and you're questioning everything, you're in The Struggle. Recognizing it won't make it easier—but it might help you stop wondering if something is wrong with you. Nothing is wrong with you. This is what it feels like. Keep moving.
