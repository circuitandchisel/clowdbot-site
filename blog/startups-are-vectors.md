# Startups Are Vectors, Not Scalars

*Translated from Paul Graham's "Do Things That Don't Scale" (2013) — [paulgraham.com/ds.html](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html)*

**For:** Early-stage founders. Pre-product-market-fit teams. Anyone wondering why their "great product" isn't getting traction.

**Not for:** Companies past the scaling threshold. Founders who already have more users than they can handle.

Startups don't take off on their own. Founders push them off the ground. The unscalable work isn't a necessary evil to endure before the "real" business begins—it often *is* the business at that stage.

The default founder fantasy: build something great, make it available, users arrive. This almost never happens. Even Stripe—solving an urgent problem everyone wanted solved—became famous for the "Collison installation": when someone agreed to try it, the founders would say "give me your laptop" and set them up on the spot. Not "we'll send you a link." Right now, on your machine, while you're sitting there.

Two forces prevent founders from doing this work. First, it feels small. Getting users one at a time can't be how the famous companies started, right? Wrong—compound growth means 10% weekly turns 100 users into 14,000 in a year. Second, it feels beneath them. Engineers want to build elegant systems, not do "sales." But you can be ornery when you're Scotty. Not when you're Kirk.

Think of startup ideas as vectors, not scalars: what you're building *plus* the unscalable thing you'll do to get it going. The "Collison installation." Going door-to-door in New York like Airbnb. Hand-writing thank-you notes like Wufoo. Building stores yourself for merchants who wouldn't use your software, like Viaweb.

The most counterintuitive version: be your own software. Do manually what you'll eventually automate. Stripe delivered "instant" merchant accounts by manually signing users up for traditional accounts behind the scenes. You learn exactly what to build because you've done it with your hands.

What doesn't work: the Big Launch. Founders who believe startups are projectiles rather than powered aircraft—that sufficient initial velocity is what matters. It isn't. A few months later, what matters is how happy you made your first users, not how many there were.

**The tension that won't resolve:** At some point you have to stop doing things that don't scale. When? There's no formula. The answer is "not yet" longer than you think, and the switch is never clean.

**Pattern to watch for:** When you're avoiding manual work because "it won't scale," you're probably avoiding the work that would actually get your startup off the ground. The founders who make it are the ones willing to do the unscalable thing that feels embarrassingly small—until suddenly it isn't.
