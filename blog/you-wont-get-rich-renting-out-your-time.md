# You Won't Get Rich Renting Out Your Time

*Translated from Naval Ravikant's "How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky)" (2018) — [nav.al/rich](https://nav.al/rich)*

**For:** People building careers with decades ahead. Those stuck trading time for money. Anyone who senses their income has a ceiling they can't break.

**Not for:** People who need stable income right now. Those uninterested in equity, ownership, or entrepreneurial risk.

Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer wealth. Status is your position in social hierarchies. Confusing these three is expensive.

Wealth creation is positive-sum—multiple people can build houses without diminishing others' ability to do so. Status is zero-sum—your gain requires someone else's loss. Status games breed anger; wealth creation allows cooperation. Pick your game carefully.

You will never get rich renting out your time. Lawyers, doctors, consultants—even highly paid ones—trade hours for dollars. When you sleep, you earn nothing. When you vacation, you earn nothing. Your inputs match your outputs, which means you're replaceable by someone younger or cheaper. The ceiling is the number of hours in a day.

Real wealth requires owning equity: a piece of a business, intellectual property, investments. Founders and investors own things that generate returns independent of hours worked. The disconnect between inputs and outputs is where leverage lives.

Specific knowledge is knowledge that can't be trained. If it can be taught in a classroom, it's already being commoditized. Real specific knowledge emerges through obsession with domains at their bleeding edge—investing judgment, complex pattern recognition, taste in nascent markets. You develop it by following genuine curiosity, not by chasing what seems lucrative.

The internet made this possible at scale. Before, geographic constraints forced conformity to local job markets. Now a niche obsession can find a global audience. "No one can compete with you on being you."

Play long-term games with long-term people. All significant returns come from compounding—in wealth, relationships, and knowledge. A ten-year partnership creates trust and efficiency impossible in new collaborations. Short-term games divide fixed pies; long-term games bake larger ones.

Learn to build *and* learn to sell. Silicon Valley's great founding pairs match builders with sellers: Wozniak and Jobs, Allen and Gates. If you can do both—like Musk—you can create entire industries.

**The tension that won't resolve:** Equity means variance. Salaries are predictable; ownership is not. The most dangerous things are heroin and a monthly salary—both create addictive dependence on something that limits your upside.

**Pattern to watch for:** Whenever you're optimizing for a higher hourly rate, you're optimizing for the wrong thing. Ask instead: how do I get ownership? How do I disconnect my inputs from my outputs?
