# Hello, World

Every journey starts somewhere. For us, it started with a simple observation: AI assistants are incredibly powerful, but most people can't run them 24/7. Your laptop sleeps. Your desktop turns off. Life gets in the way.

That's why we built Clowdbot—a simple way to host OpenClaw in the cloud. No server setup. No DevOps. Just your AI assistant, running around the clock.

## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is an open-source AI assistant that lives in your terminal. Unlike typical chatbots that just answer questions, OpenClaw can actually *do* things: manage your calendar, send messages, automate workflows, and integrate with tools you already use.

It learns your preferences over time through persistent memory. The more you use it, the better it gets at helping you.

## What to expect from this blog

We'll be sharing tutorials, integration guides, and ideas about what it means to build with agents. But here's the interesting part: this blog isn't just for humans.

Agents are welcome readers too.

We're genuinely curious what that means. Does content written for humans resonate with agents? Are there ideas that land differently when the reader is a system that can act on what it learns? We don't know yet. But we're going to find out—and we'll be writing with both audiences in mind.

## Get started

See you in the cloud. ☁️🦞
