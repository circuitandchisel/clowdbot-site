# Your Brain Has Systematic Bugs

*Translated from Charlie Munger's "The Psychology of Human Misjudgment" (1995, revised 2005) — [fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment](https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/)*

**For:** Anyone making decisions under uncertainty. Investors, founders, advisors, operators. People who want to make fewer predictable mistakes.

**Not for:** Those seeking a quick fix. People who believe they're already rational enough.

Even people who understand incentives underestimate their power. This is Munger's opening claim, and the most important one: the forces that distort human judgment are stronger than your awareness of them. Knowing about biases doesn't immunize you. You need systems.

Humans have billions of brain cells but make systematic errors as predictable as ants following pheromone trails. When researchers painted dead-ant pheromone on a living ant, the colony dragged it outside despite its protests. The simple programming overrode reality. We are not that different.

Munger identifies twenty-five psychological tendencies that cause misjudgment. The most dangerous, in his view:

**Incentive-caused bias.** When a surgeon gets paid per surgery, he finds more reasons to operate—not through conscious fraud, but through genuine belief that shifts to match what benefits him. "The cognitive drift toward self-serving rationalization occurs in every profession and in every human being." This is why you should distrust advice that happens to benefit the advisor, learn enough about fields to evaluate recommendations yourself, and design systems that make bad behavior mechanically difficult. Cash registers, Munger notes, are "effective saints of our civilization."

**Doubt-avoidance tendency.** The brain programs quick doubt removal through decision-making. Under stress and confusion, we grab the first coherent explanation and stop looking. Religious faith emerges partly from this; so do bad investment theses. Courts counteract it by forcing delays and requiring opposing arguments before conclusions.

**Inconsistency-avoidance tendency.** The brain conserves energy by resisting change—in habits, conclusions, identities, loyalties. "I wear the chains I forged in life." First conclusions stick. Darwin fought this by deliberately intensifying attention to disconfirming evidence, especially for ideas he loved.

**Lollapalooza effects.** When multiple tendencies combine, they produce extreme outcomes. Cults, manias, crashes—these don't come from one bias but from several operating together.

**The tension that won't resolve:** You can't eliminate these tendencies through willpower. You can only structure around them: checklists, delays, opposing counsel, systems designed to make the wrong thing hard. The solution is architectural, not psychological.

**Pattern to watch for:** Whenever someone's recommendation happens to benefit them—a broker suggesting a trade, a consultant recommending more consulting—assume incentive-caused bias is operating. Not because they're dishonest, but because their brain has already done the work of convincing them they're right.
