# Measurement and Leverage

*Translated from Paul Graham's "How to Make Wealth" (2004) — [paulgraham.com/wealth.html](https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html)*

**For:** People who want to create wealth (not just earn money). Anyone evaluating startup vs. big company. Those confused about why some people get rich and others don't.

**Not for:** People optimizing for stability. Those who need predictable income above all else.

Wealth is not money. Wealth is stuff people want—and you can create it. A programmer typing code is literally manufacturing something valuable. Money is just how we move wealth around. Confusing the two makes it harder to understand how to get either.

The pie is not fixed. When you restore an old car, the world has one more pristine car. You haven't taken from anyone. Most people retain a childhood intuition that wealth is zero-sum; starting a company is a bet that they're wrong.

To get rich, you need two things: **measurement** and **leverage**. Measurement means your output can be evaluated. Leverage means your decisions have outsized effects. Missing either one caps your upside.

Piecework in a sweatshop has measurement but no leverage—you can only work so fast. A CEO has both: the company's performance is their performance, and their decisions move everything. Movie stars, athletes, hedge fund managers—everyone who gets rich by their own efforts has both.

Startups are the accessible path to this combination. Smallness provides measurement (in a 10-person company, you're within a factor of 10 of individual contribution). Technology provides leverage (solve a problem once, help everyone who uses your solution). A restaurant serves customers one at a time. Software scales.

Big companies can't offer this deal. You can't walk into your boss's office and say "I'd like to work 10x harder, please pay me 10x more." They have no way to measure it, and your work is tangled with everyone else's. The company averages your contribution with a thousand other people's—and the average of a thousand people is pretty average.

Here's the catch: the payoff is only proportionate *on average*. The distribution is brutal. You might be 30x more productive and get paid 30x more—or you might get zero. Most startups fail. A startup is a mosquito: no energy on defense, designed purely to score. The species survives because there are many; individual mosquitos don't find this comforting.

**The tension that won't resolve:** You can't choose your spot on the curve. You can't say "I'll work 3x harder for 3x the pay." When you're running a startup, your competitors decide how hard you work. And they all decide the same thing: as hard as possible.

**Pattern to watch for:** If your job feels safe, you're probably not in a position with leverage. Upside requires downside. The moment you could get fired for underperforming is the moment you might get rewarded for overperforming.
